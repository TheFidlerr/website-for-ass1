<h1> Personal Information </h1>
<p> My name is Cory-Jay Fidler, student number S3885481, email s3885481@student.rmit.edu.au. I am currently 20 years old, living in Melbourne, Victoria. Taking introduction to IT is my first step into education in IT, and I am taking this course alongside intro to programming which I am enjoying. Despite retaining no knowledge at all, I taught myself basic HTML when I was about 15.
Here is a photo of me (right) and my wonderful partner, Kieara (left).

My interest in IT started at age 7, when I first got my hand on a PlayStation 2 and starting indulging in way too many hours of grand theft auto san andreas. This game is still my favorite of all time as it started my interest in video games, and all IT really. Another thing that sparked my interest in IT is my uncle, who was and still is a computer tech, and he still teaches me to this day.
I chose to study at RMIT because I think it was the best choice for what I want to study. After intro to IT and intro to programming I would like to further my studies into programming. During my studies I expect to learn all about IT, the jobs I can get from learning IT, and also see what my strong points and weak points are currently in regards to my knowledge of IT.

<h1> Ideal Job </h1>
<p> https://www.seek.com.au/job/51100266?type=standard#searchRequestToken=5d223573-21cd-46ca-90d5-56c6a0e2de61
This position is a software development position, which would require me to code and upkeep certain software (in this case related to hospitality and gaming). This job is interesting to me as it directly relates to programming, something I have a passion for. To be considered for this job I would need to be proficient in programming, namely Java, C# and dart. I would also need to have previous experience doing something similar to this job. I currently have none of these qualifications, and despite having a passion for programming I have almost no knowledge of it. To get the qualifications I will need to complete more university courses, obviously software engineering course, but I would also most likely have to complete year 12 through university or tafe as I never completed year 12. <br>

 <h1> Personal Profile </h1>
 <p> After completing 3 tests, my results are as follows.
https://www.16personalities.com/
The personality test results said I was a ‘turbulent virtuoso’. In short this suggests I am hands on and learn best by looking and feeling, and I enjoy making things for the fun of making things, and will move from project to project.

This learning style test said that I am a tactile learner, this means the test says I learn by touching and doing (similar to the personality test) and that I learn best when some sort of physical activity is involved, and I am allowed frequent breaks. It also suggests I enjoy taking things apart and then putting them back together.

The final test is a leadership style quiz, and this test states that I am a contrarian leader which in short means I am free from binary thinking, rarely jumping to either/or conclusions. It also says that I can hold conflicting ideas in my head for a long time

The results from each of these tests in all honesty doesn’t mean anything to me, although they got some things right, it would be hard to grasp my personality from a set of 20-50 multiple choice answers. This means they have a narrow set of things that the program can output, and cannot possibly understand all types of people. Personally, I think these should be taken with a grain of salt and are obviously not the exact tests used by employers. In saying this, these tests will not really affect me when forming or being in a team. Although if these tests are to be taken as fact, I will definitely have a go at learning more with my hands and taking short, frequent breaks.

<h1> Project Idea </h1>
<p> My project idea is a very practical use of a raspberry pi to check and then warn drivers of low tire tread. This will be mildly similar to a low tire pressure warning that most cars after 2006 have installed from factory. I want to program the raspberry pi to have a visual warning when tire tread is getting low, and a sound warning when it gets below the mark of roadworthiness. <br>
<br>
The motivation behind this project is the fact that many people who are not very mechanically minded often don’t know how to check how much tread they have left on their tires, and if they do, they don’t know what the road worthy depth is. A study done by Canstar Blue, a consumer research company, showed that of 1600 motorists 40% of them didn’t know the legal tire safety standards. This means 2/5 cars on the road could be driving with unroadworthy tread. <br>
<br>
This product will be easy to use and to navigate, knowing not all people are mechanically minded or have any experience with IT. It will be an extension or upgrade to current car interior command centers (ICC) and doesn’t only have to be used for tire tread warning. The raspberry pi will be a base for this product, as it is an easy and cheap way to get information in a car without being bulky and hard to install. This means everything else that comes with raspberry pi’s will be able to be installed in each vehicle, including reverse sensors and other safety features that may not be present in vehicles from factory. This product will check all tires, not just one, to make sure all tread is road worthy and safe to drive on. Having a warning when tire tread is getting low, not just when it isn’t roadworthy means people can be informed when it is best to change tires as being roadworthy by law doesn’t mean that is necessarily safe, as this is dependent on the quality of the tires on the car and shouldn’t be judged by a broad spectrum. Raspberry pi’s can also recognize voice, which adds to the accessibility of this product as you wont even need to navigate menus, you can just ask the mini computer. The product will also be able to very accurately tell you the depth of your tread even when not low, just by checking the computer or, again, using voice commands. This product needs to be non-intrusive, as to not distract drivers but the product will still give a warning that is obvious enough and will be seen so the driver can take action. Being born from a program it will be easy enough to add and maintain more tire information, after some time it will also be able to tell you what tires you should be buying, as there are tires for winter, summer and also all-season tires and this can be crucial. This program will also be able to be easily fed different roadworthy depths, as different countries and states have different laws surrounding the depth required to be roadworthy. <br>
<br>
The tools and technologies for this project or product can be narrowed down to just a few main components, a raspberry pi, the brains behind the whole product where it will be able to tell you what a 3d laser scanner, although subject to change, that has accurate depth perception knows about your tires. For the program to be able to tell you what tires you need it will also need a temperature sensor, although these are usually installed in newer cars. <br>
<br>
The skills required for this project will mainly be programming, obviously to code the program and make it accessible and easy to use. Another main skill that is required will be a mechanic as they will be required to install laser scanners, without compromising the structure of the vehicle it is being installed on. The final base skill will be an auto electrician, as they will need to power laser scanners and the carputer, although easily powered through obd2, as these may be installed on older cars without and obd2 port. <br>
<br>
In conclusion the outcome of this product will be a safety feature that is cheap, which means it needs to be easy to install at home or easy enough for someone else to install where it won’t cost a fortune to have it installed on your car.            It also means it will have components that are inexpensive and plentiful. It will be easily accessible by all drivers as drivers are a very diverse group of people and it needs to be easily understood by all of them. <br>
